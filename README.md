This is a branch dedicated to non-adaptive possibilities; the source repository of the [AIOCJ development framework](http://www.cs.unibo.it/projects/jolie/aiocj.html) can be found [here](https://github.com/thesave/aiocj).
For choreographies that do not use the _adaptation middleware_ of the framework, here it is removed resulting in a significative improvement in execution speed (see the comparison below).
