### Improvements

- [ ] Add command to Environment Service to print the list of all variables and their values;
- [ ] When checking the applicability of a rule that introduces new roles, first check if the related role_supporter is reachable. In case it is not, report the error and skip the rule;
- [ ] When compiling, if the check for *connectedness* returns an error, ask to the user whether to continue with the compilation or not.
